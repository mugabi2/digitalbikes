    <string name="textForAbout">He who [a]dwells in the shelter of the Most High
Will remain secure and rest in the shadow of the Almighty [whose power no enemy can withstand].
2
I will say of the Lord, “He is my refuge and my fortress,
My God, in whom I trust [with great confidence, and on whom I rely]!”
3
For He will save you from the trap of the fowler,
And from the deadly pestilence.
4
He will cover you and completely protect you with His pinions,
And under His wings you will find refuge;
His faithfulness is a shield and a wall.
5
You will not be afraid of the terror of night,
Nor of the arrow that flies by day,
6
Nor of the pestilence that stalks in darkness,
Nor of the destruction (sudden death) that lays waste at noon.
7
A thousand may fall at your side
And ten thousand at your right hand,
But danger will not come near you.
8
You will only [be a spectator as you] look on with your eyes
And witness the [divine] repayment of the wicked [as you watch safely from the shelter of the Most High].
9
Because you have made the Lord, [who is] my refuge,
Even the Most High, your dwelling place,
10
No evil will befall you,
Nor will any plague come near your tent.
11
For He will command His angels in regard to you,
To protect and defend and guard you in all your ways [of obedience and service].
12
They will lift you up in their hands,
So that you do not [even] strike your foot against a stone.
13
You will tread upon the lion and cobra;
The young lion and the serpent you will trample underfoot.
14
“Because he set his love on Me, therefore I will save him;
I will set him [securely] on high, because he knows My name [he confidently trusts and relies on Me, knowing I will never abandon him, no, never].

        Inspect, Then Ride
The team works hard to maintain each bicycle but it’s important to ensure that tires are inflated and brakes operate correctly before you ride. Bike riders should also adjust their seat height accordingly.

Limit your speed.
Every rider should use a speed they can handle. No need to go fast.

Brake Early and Gradually
Always brake early and gradually – especially when going downhill.

Use both brakes
Bike riders should use both brakes at the same time.

Follow Traffic Laws
Yield to pedestrians, ride in the direction of traffic, use hand signals, keep left, and come to a complete stop at red lights and follow signs.

Make sure motorists can see you
Ride in a position where you can see and be seen, consider wearing bright or reflective clothing Avoid riding in other vehicles’ blind spots.

Use your bell - not all pedestrians can see you.

Attention!
Never cycle along the inside of large vehicles, such as lorries and buses, especially at junctions.
Be mindful of large vehicles making wide turns.
Be watchful of stones on the road.
Do not use mobile devices to talk or text while riding.
Never ride under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
